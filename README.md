The following program was made from Oracle.com instructions. 

Scenario - OraclProduction
OraclProduction Ltd are specialists in producing production line manufacturing plants.
They could be asked to create a production plant for any type of product ranging from 
a simple packaging system to a variety of electronic devices.
Recently they have been asked to create a production line for multimedia devices which 
include music and movie players. They wish to employee you to design a template in Java for creating and recording all future production line items. For this particular production facility you will only implement a concrete class for music and movie players.
Your task is to create a flexible structure that could be used in any production line. This structure would then allow easy modification to handle different products.

The projet is still on process of developing and will be completed by end of November 2018. 
This project was assign during my Junior year 2018 in my Object Oriented Programming.
